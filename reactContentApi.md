prop drilling is not good.

so when we will create checkout component then we will install a package.
so this package basically format all the pricing in the format we want it to be.
then we require it  like imoport it in react.

// creating login project
setting up firebase.
 for that we have to make a file called firebase.js and after adding every thing to it
 we have to install package npm i firebase

 so to make our login in first thing first.
 have to go to authentication on firebase page then to sign in method and then click on email password and enable it.

 // so thing to remember as react link gives us very usefull hook called react hook usedHistory.  so this is what tells us the history if user is logged in or out.

 after that in our app.js we will make this.
 // so this useEffect first argument it takes is function and the other is dependency.
// so basically this useEffect will run once when the app will be loaded but if we put 
// basket in [] and every single time the basket will change it will run then.
useEffect(() => {
  
}, [])

then we will import our auth in app.js


// deploing stuff.
  so for deploying first thing we will do is 
  1. firebase login
  2. firebase init
  3. say yes
  4 .use arrow keys to go down to hosting and press enter
  5. use an existing project.
  6. find existing project mine is amazon-clone
  7. where it says public directory? we have to write build with it other wise it won't work.
  8. says yes. so it will say firebase initialization complete.
  9. we have to run this command then npm run build 
  10. and last one is firebase deploy.
